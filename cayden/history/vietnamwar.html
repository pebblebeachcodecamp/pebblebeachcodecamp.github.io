            <p>The Vietnam War was a longlasting 20 year war that killed over millions of human lives on both sides which are the North Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese. 
                The war started in 1955 to 1975, the fall of Saigon, then South Vietnam's capital. The North Vietnam had a special infantry group called the Vietcong. They were tasked to go to  
                enemy lines and hide out in tunnels to set traps for the South Vietnamese and the <a href="coalitionmeaning.html">COALITION </a>forces to kill them.
                Many traps succeeded , killing troops and it was so deadly that Americans had to crouch in order to see trapdoors, grenade wires and many more traps to name. 
                In the end, the North won due to the advantage that there were less and less South Vietnamese soldiers due to the South Vietnamese not giving enough rations and salaries.
                Now, Vietnam is ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam.

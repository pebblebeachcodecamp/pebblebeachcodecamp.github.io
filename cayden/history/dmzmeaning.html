            <p>The DMZ is a border line between the Koreas in the Korean Peninsula. The DMZ works as a defence to both Koreas so that spies can't go in or out of both Koreas. 
                The DMZ has minefields, gun towers, dogs and soldiers manning the DMZ on both sides. However, there is a small zone in the DMZ where the two parties can communicate
                There are blue shacks with tinted windows on both sides and there are two soldiers standing between them. A South Korean Border officer and a North Korean soldier. 
                They both wear formal uniform and stand there for shifts.

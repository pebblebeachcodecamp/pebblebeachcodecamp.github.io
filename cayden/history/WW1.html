            <h1>Learn about World War 1!</h1>
            <h3>Created on Friday, July 26th, 2024</h3>
            <p>World War 1 was the biggest and possibly the most influential war in history. It shown the use of new equipment such as tanks
               and bomber to the use of new tactics such as trench warfare. It also changed geography a lot as German land were used by other countries.
               So in June 28th,1914, a Serbian assasin group came to the city of Sarvejo. They were called the black hand and their mission was to assinaite
               the Austrian-Hungarian  Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The Black Hand hated the Austrian heir and wanted to kill their next to-be leader so they sent 11 people to kill him 
               Out of the 11 little missions, 10 of them failed. Just as when the 11th person began to wrap up and go home, he spotted the Archduke coming in his way so he got out his revovler 
               and shot 3 shots, 2 hit the Archduke and 1 hit the Archduke's wife. After the sudden incident, the Austrian-Hungarians decided to respond by attacking the Serbs, thus declaring war on them and then the Germans also joined in because Austria-Hungary was their ally.
               But the Austrians and Germans  didn't anticipate that the Russians declared war on the Austrians and Germans since Serbia was Russia's close ally. Then, the Germans wanted to avoid a 2 sided attack by the Russians and 
               French*Because the French were also Serbia's and Russia's ally* so they went to fight with France first. But they had to first cross to Belgium to fight France and then suddenly, because
               Belgium was being attacked, the entire British Empire rallied to fight against the Germans thus starting World War 1.  </p>

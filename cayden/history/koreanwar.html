            <p>The Korean War was a conflict between the two sides, North Korea and South Korea. It was supposed 
                to be a peaceful stationary land for the Soviet Union and the United States but when the North, led by 
                Kim II Sung, needed more land, they attacked the border of South Korean territory hence starting the Korean War.
                Whaat followed during the 3 years was mass bloodshed, new weapons being used and many, many POW exchanges. When 
                the war ended in 1953, that didn't mean that this type of conflict was over. After the war, North Koreans and South Koreans
                still end up disliking eachother, causing further sadness to the families on both sides who have members of their family
                on the other side of the Korean Peninsula.

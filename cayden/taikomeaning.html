        <h1>What is Taiko?</h1>
        <h3>Created on Tuesday, July 23rd, 2024</h3>
        <p>Taiko is a type of a Japanese percussion instrument and had been in Japan for many years. I joined Taiko class and so far, I have 
            been on the yearly Taiko trip once. It is hard to play as you need to learn the right posture, the right beat and you need to memorise
            almost 15 pages of continuous music. There are 4 sets of drums, the Odaiko, the Shimidaiko, the Wadaiko and the black box drum*Our taiko 
            teacher didn't specify the official drum name.* I play the biggest and hardest drum to play which is the Odaiko as it is harder to amplify 
            the sound. That's it for Taiko.

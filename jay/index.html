        <h1>Baseball's history, the teams I like,and the best players in the country.</h1>
        
        <p>Basball was frst started in 1845. Alexander Cartwright made the first rules.Alexander Cartwright was in New York Knickerbockers
So, the first rule was called The Knickerbocker Rule. America,Korea,Japan,Venezuela,Cuba,and The Dominican Republic are countries that show high interest in baseball. They have players that represent there countries.</p>

        <p>The world's superstar is Shohei Ohtani. He is a very famous baseball player in Japan. He is playing in the LA Dodgers right now. He has a lot of records that are broken. For example he is the second player to do the posistion of a pitcher and the batter. The first player was Babe Ruth.</p>
        <p>There are many leagues in baseball. For example, there is the MLB(Major League Baseball) and the KBO League(Korean baseball organization)
    The MLB is the biggest league in the world because It has the most teams and it is very famous.
    There are other leagues such as The NPB(Nippon Professional Baseball) which is a Japan league.
    However MLB is the most unique since it is divided into 2 leagues. The American League and the National League. They are also divided in the location of the state.
    The MLB has 30 teams divided into 2. The KBO league has 10 teams. The NPB leauge has 12teams divided into 2.
The 2023 American Series Champions were the Texas Rangers. The Korean Series were the LG Twins that is Located in the capital city of Korea which is Seoul.
The Japan series Champions are The Hanshin tigers. They won the series in 68years.
The WBC is the most famous baseball championship in the world. Mostly Japan and US takes the Champion trophies.
In WBC, there are 20 teams that play 31 games. The most recent champions were Japan. Mostly countries like Japan,Korea,America,Cuba,Mexico,Canada,Chile,The Dominican Republic,and Venezuela are in the championships.</p>
Now I will talk about my favorite team LG Twins. There home stadium is Jamsil Baseball stadium. They have been the Jorean Series for 3 times.1990,1994,2023.
I like that team since my home town is Seoul and in LG, there is my favorite player Park-Yong-Taik.
He is a LG Twins legend his back number is 33. His position is a left fielder and the designated hitter.
Also, I like LG Twins because my friends all like LG Twins and they wanted me to be a Twins fan too. I was in the 5th match of the Korean series and I watched my favorite team being the Korean series Champions. They were finally champions after 29 long years. 
I was so happy that I almost cried. I saw the ceremony and it was very exciting. They were blasting champange all over the ground and there were confetti and fire works everywhere.
I hope that the LG Twins be the Champions every year.
Next I will talk about my favorite MLB team, The Sanfransisco Giants. I became a fan of the Giants because almost all of my friends live in Monterey and the most closest area that has a baseball team is Sanfransisco.
Also, I watched MLB in TV and I saw a Giants hitter hit a homerun and I was impressed and became an Giants fan. Also, in the Giants there is a Korean player called Jung-Hoo-Lee. I like him very much. 
Lastly I don't care a lot about NPB but I like the Junich Dragons and the Yomiuri Giants because they both had the Korean legend Seung-youp-Lee,Sun-dong-yeol.
They are the best hitter and pitcher in Korea. They both have about 10 records.
Now I will talk about the best players of the country. First is America. There are so many legends but if I pick only one, I will pick Babe Ruth. He was so good that he was the first player to have a multi posistion.
Originally, the best player in the league has hitted about 15 home runs. However, rookie Babe Ruth had hit 29 home runs and astonished everyone in the country. He was a super rookie and the Yankees were glad they had him.
Also, he is a small portion of players that didn't have steroid and was legendary. When he retired there were no people that didn't know his name and he became the number 1 legend and player for the Americans.
Many people that are interested in baseball say that there will be no person like him for a million years and he will be the best player for ever.
However, there is someone in Japan that has almost took his place of a legend. It is Shohei Ohtan. I told you in the front of the website but he is absolutley legendary.
He is like the younger Babe Ruth that has a better personality. For example, his routine is picking up trash that is in the stadium and trash it. Mostly players just ignore th trash but Ohtani picks it up.
Almost no players have done that action in history. That is why he is world famous and many people admire him and like him. 
However it is not only because of personality. He is excellent at baseball. He has so many records that we cannot count it. He also keeps his promise of doing his daily routine everyday.
These are the reasons why people like him.
Finally, the best player from korea is Lee-seung-youp. He is the most famous batter in Korea. In 2008,he had the Asian homerun record. He hitted 626 homeruns in his career.
The 676th homerun ball was sold in 100000 dollars. It was amazing. He played in Japan in the Yomiuri Giants. He was a legend there too so the Giants fans like him too.
Also, he is a hero of Korea. In the 2006 WBC, He hit a homerun that changed the game against Japan. All the people that were seeing the game cheered.
He also has the nickname Lion King. It is because he was in the KBO team Samsung Lions and he was the king of the league. He will be a legend forever.
The best pitcher in Korea is Sun-dong-yol. He played at Japan as well. In korea he was in Haitai Tigers. His backnumber is 18. He is a sidearm pitcher.
He has so many huge records that his records are untouchable for other players. In 1996 he was the master in the leauge. He had the lowest ERA, most strike outs,most saves, most wins, most games played.
At that time this was impossible to reach. He got the MVP for 7 straight years and has 11 golden gloves. It was absolutley incredible. He also brought the Haitai Tigers to the championships 10 times!
 He will always be a legend in Korea.

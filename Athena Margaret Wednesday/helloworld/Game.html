            <h1 class='TP'> POLLUTION CONSERVANTION GAME! </h1>
            <a href="file:///Users/loaner4/projects/helloworld/ggaammee.html" class="button" id="BUTTON">PLAY</a>   
            <p> When they open the game, the first thing they see is a blue ocean screen.
                 The only option is play, this game is on a small platfrom so i think it would take longer to add a bunce of stuff to a small game. 
                 When they click play, it takes them to a little Beach with their own character. 
                 The goal of the game is to click on the piles of trash that are in the ocean ocean they click the pile/s they are teleported to a background that is Surrounded by trash.
                  It then it shows the parts they are trash, and the animals that are stuck in trash. 
                  They have to use the scroll to click on the piles of trash and remove them from the hurt sea animals. 
                   You then click on the trash and it is put in the recycle bin.  
                   Once the trash is off the animals you tap on them twice and they and put in a sea tank.</p>
